Graphical interface of the software system for controlling the movement of a mobile robot

## Background

The main purpose of a software system for controlling the movement of a mobile robot is to provide the average user with the opportunity to control a mobile robot, both within the same local network and remotely.
The main feature of the software system is the previously taken developments of the autonomous navigation algorithm of the mobile robot and an early prototype of the client application, which need to be implemented into the software system. 
The requirement for the system was to provide the ability to control the robot from a remote device in NAT conditions. 
In view of these features, it was determined that the software system should consist of three parts: a client application, a protocol conversion module as part of the built-in software of the mobile robot and a server.

***The client application is provided here, offline navigation for the mobile robot is provided, and the server installer is provided in other repositories.***
